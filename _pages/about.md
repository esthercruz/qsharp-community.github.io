This group collects + maintains projects related to the Q# programming language by a community of folks who are excited about quantum programming!
The types of content hosted here are (but are not limited to):

- New community libraries for Q#
- Tutorial or workshop materials featuring Q# code
- Extensions to the Q# language itself that need some testing before being added to official repositories
- Blog posts on cool Q# projects or documenting how you use the QKD

If you want to learn more about the process of adding a project to [qsharp-community](https://qsharp.community), please see our [community contribution guide](./_pages/CONTRIBUTING.md).

We have a community [Gitter](https://gitter.im/qsharp-community/community?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link), so please ask the community if you have a question about Q# or the QDK, want us to cross-promote or host a blog post, or want to share a cool project you are working on!

> Our community uses the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) as a code of conduct, please email [info@quantum.community](mailto:info@quantum.community) if you have any questions or need to report something.
